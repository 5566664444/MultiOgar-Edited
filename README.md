# MultiOgar - Edited.

An open source server that's fast and supports multiple protocol versions.

Since august 2016 [Barbosik](https://github.com/Barbosik) has stopped working on this project. 
<br>Due to this I have decided to continue improving his work in order to make this project even better!



# Info 

Current version : **1.5.0**

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-node.js-yellow.svg)

Original MultiOgar code is based on the private server implementation [Ogar](https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar).
<br>This has greatly been improved by me and a couple of helpers.
<br>However the original code rightfully belongs to the [OgarProject](https://github.com/OgarProject).
<br>The overall goal of this fork is to improve the physics and add new features while maintaining a good preformance.
