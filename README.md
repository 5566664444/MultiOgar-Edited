## [![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ogar-Node-red.svg)](https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar) Ogar
Copy of Ogar that I heavily modified, and will continue to update. 
The [OgarProject](https://ogarproject.com) owns Ogar, and I do not claim it as mine! 
Original Ogar found [here](https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar)


The goal is to cleanup the code, fix the bugs and improve physics.
